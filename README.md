Weather Dashboard Webpage



## Description

The Weather Dashboard Webpage was created with the purpose of providing the user a tool to know the weather conditions on a desired location or city. The user will be able to see the current weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV Index. In addition, the application will show the weather for the 5 days following the current date.

By working on this project, I learned how to connect to APIs and manage the data.
